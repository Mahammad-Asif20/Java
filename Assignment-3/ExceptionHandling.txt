Make a note on the ways to handle Exceptions in java:


1]1. Try-Catch Block:
   * The most common way to handle exceptions.
   * Code that might throw an exception is written inside the try block.
   * The catch block handles the exception.

2]Multiple Catch Blocks:
   * Used when different types of exceptions may occur in the same try block.

3]Finally Block:
   * Always executes after the try-catch, whether an exception occurred or not.
   * Used to close resources like files, DB connections, etc.

4]Throw Keyword:
   * Used to explicitly throw an exception.

5]Throws Keyword:
   * Declares exceptions in method signature. Used to pass the responsibility of handling exception to the calling method.
