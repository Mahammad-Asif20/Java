Make a note on Collection Framework.

*The Collection Framework in Java is a set of classes and interfaces used to store, retrieve, and manipulate groups of objects (like lists, sets, and maps).

Uses:
  *To store multiple elements (objects).
  *To avoid using arrays when data size is unknown or dynamic.
  *Built-in sorting, searching, and manipulation.
  *Supports data structures like List, Set, Queue, and Map.

Interfaces in Collection Framework:

1]List:
   * A List is an ordered collection in Java that allows duplicate elements.
   * List preserves the insertion order, meaning the elements appear in the order in which they were added.
   * In a List, we can access elements using an index, just like in an array.

 Common Implementations:
 *ArrayList	 
 *LinkedList	
 *Vector

2]Set:
   * A Set is a collection that does not allow duplicate elements
   * It is used when you want to store unique values only.
   * In a Set, we cannot access elements using an index.

Common Implementations:
 *HashSet	
 *LinkedHashSet	
 *TreeSet	

3]Map:
   * A Map is a data structure in Java used to store key-value pairs.
   * Each key is unique, but values can be duplicated.
  
Common Implementations:
 *HashMap
 *LinkedHashMap	
 *TreeMap	


3]Queue:
    * A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle:
         FIFO = First In, First Out
         The element that is added first will be removed first.
    * insertion happens at the rear (end).
    * Removal happens at the front (beginning).
 
 Common Implementations:
   * PriorityQueue.
   * ArrayDeque.
